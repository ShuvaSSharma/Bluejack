/* 
Today, I'll be recreating one of my favorite card games: Blackjack. Going to call this project 'Bluejack' because I was sad I lost the game the day I decided to recreate it (haha).
The rules (if you're unfamiliar):

    Objective: Get closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding 21.
    Card Values: Number cards = face value, face cards = 10, Ace = 1 or 11.
    Start: Players and dealer get 2 cards; one of the dealerâ€™s cards is face up.
    Player Options:
    Hit: Take a card.
    Stand: Keep current hand.
    Double Down: Double bet, take one card.
    Split: Divide matching cards into two hands.
    Dealer: Must hit until at least 17; stands on 17+.
    Winning: Closest to 21 without busting (over 21) wins. Blackjack (Ace + 10) beats other 21s.
    Bust: Exceed 21 and lose. Tie with dealer = push (no winner).
